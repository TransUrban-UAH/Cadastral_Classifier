# multi-model-approach
R-packages

This is a comparison between multimodel approach and stepwise selection of variables in a logistic model framework.

Several methods exist for the selection of variables when creating models to assess the level of association between different variables selection methods.

I will use data describing the expansion of tree plantation in the Lingue basin in the south-central Chile to assess different methods of variables selection associated wi

The analysis will be made in R using two different packages: The mumln and glmulti. 

The data was obtained by remoted sensing classification of landsat images for the year 1987, 2002, 2015. The land cover were classified in 7 classes: Native forest, Tree plantation, agriculture, waterbodies.
