**Cadastral Classifier (CC)** is a plugin to classify urban parcels of any Spanish municipality (excluding Navarra and País Vasco) using cadastral information (obtainable via official channels). It has been developed under version 3.16 of QGIS, that includes a Python 3.7 version and a QT Designer version, and it supports versión 3.0 or higher.

The main objective is to offer, to a different user profiles, the possibility of carrying out classifications of spanish municipalities at parcel level, by implementing 3 types of classifications, that increase in complexity and depths on their analysis.

This development has been carried out within the framework of the SIM4PLAN project, financed by the R+D+i Projects Proof of Concept 2021 from the Ministry of Science and Innovation of the Government of Spain and NextGenerationEU of the European Union, with reference PDC2021-121568-C21, as well as the grant “Stimulus to Excellence for Permanent University Professors” with reference EPU-INV/2020/009 from the UAH and the Community of Madrid, granted to Dr. Francisco Aguilera Benavente. Both sources of funding have allowed the Cadastral Classifier plugin to be made available to users free of charge.
